# Accessibility Projects

This folder contains projects focused on building inclusive and accessible web pages. These exercises emphasize best practices in semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and accessibility features that ensure content is usable by everyone, including those using assistive technologies.

## Projects

### 🛒 Checkout Page
**Description**:  
Create an accessible checkout page using proper semantic structure. Practice using `alt` attributes for images and introducing ARIA roles to improve the experience for screen reader users.

### 🎬 Movie Review Page
**Description**:  
Build a movie review page that demonstrates accessible design. You'll work with semantic HTML, `alt` attributes, accessible lists, and use `aria-hidden` to hide decorative content from screen readers.

### 📽️ Multimedia Player
**Description**:  
Create a simple multimedia player using HTML’s `<audio>` and `<video>` elements. Practice using the `controls` attribute and `aria-label` to ensure the player is accessible to users with screen readers.
